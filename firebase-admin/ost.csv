I also love children which I also have one of my own whose still a toddler and enjoy teaching him new things everyday and watching him development day by day. I am also always interested in learning new skills in order to make myself more employable. Also I believe it's way more fun and interesting to see teach kids of a tender age as they are our future and with the proper training n teaching techniques we use to get them ready for every step left from baby to adulthood that our future will look bright.","No","","","","Micoud Secondary School and Sir Arthur Lewis Community College","Cxc mathematics (3), English (2), social Studies (3), integrated Science (2), history(3), clothing and Textiles (2), physical Education (2) and sociology (D), history (C), General Paper (d)","Cxc certificate

I believe this program can help promote/market, financially assist and network my brand to the regional and international media, PR and management services, as I would like to network my brand with global brands in the same sector to be able to achieve this goal. Example, The brand Rihanna has brought a lot of awareness and tourism opportunities to her country Barbados and has greatly inspired the younger generation to dream higher! That is my goal, to become one of the biggest influential Chefs in the Caribbean, in the world, and to be able to hold my Island’s flag and let the world know where I came from and the nation that inspired me to cook soulful, beautiful, delicious food.
