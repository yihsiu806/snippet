This is a type of critical error that is detected by processor hardware that may be related to internal storage or state machine corruption or external errors that affect the ability of the hardware to continue processing the intended instruction flow. The error is typically associated with the generation of a corresponding software interrupt called a machine check exception. Depending on the error, it may or may not be able to be corrected by additional actions by software that handles the machine check exception."
